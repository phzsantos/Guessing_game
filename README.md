# Guessing Game

This is a project in python to learn algorithms. I'm trying to do a algorithm that guess the number that the user thought.

## How it works

It's a simple game, you choose a number between 1 and 10 and press ENTER, the algorithm gonna try to guess your number. You can also play with another range of numbers like 1 to 100 and etc. Remember that the algorithm improves accuracy every time you play the game.

## How to run it

**Requirements:**  
Python 3.6 or higher installed  
CMD/PowerShell/Terminal Access

Don't have python installed? [Python official download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1 - Clone the repository or just download it:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/phzsantos/Guessing_game
```

2 - Open your CMD/PowerShell/Terminal and run it:
```shell
python3 run.py
```

I hope you enjoy it :).
