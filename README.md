# Guessing Game

This is a project in python to learn algorithms. I'm trying to do a algorithm that guess the number that the user thought.

## How it works

It's a simple game, you choose a number between 1 and 10 and press ENTER, the algorithm gonna try to guess your number. You can also play with another range of numbers like 1 to 100 and etc.

## To Do

- [x] README
- [x] Refactor the code
- [x] Guess the number
- [x] Don't repeat tries
- [x] Try the next number according to user answer
- [x] If the first try is the lower or higher chance and it's not the user number automatically try another number
- [x] If there's only one number left, don't ask the user if that is the number choosed, just affirm that is
- [x] Don't let the user choose a invalid lower or higher option if the current try -1 or +1 is equal to last try
- [x] Make the code scalable
- [x] Gamemode (standard 1-10 or custom)
- [ ] Create functions
- [ ] Make the code modular
- [x] When the game ends ask if the user want to play again
- [ ] Translate the code to english

**Thanks for read me!**
