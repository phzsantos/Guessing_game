# Guessing Game

This is a project in python to learn algorithms. I'm trying to do a algorithm that guess the number that the user thought.

## How it works

It's a simple game, you choose a number between 0 and 10 and press ENTER, the algorithm gonna try to guess your number.

## To Do

- [x] README
- [x] Refactor the code
- [x] Guess the number
- [x] Don't repeat tries
- [ ] Try the next number according to user answer

**Thanks for read me!**
