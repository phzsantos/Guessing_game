# Guessing Game

This is a project in python to learn algorithms. I'm trying to do a algorithm that guess the number that the user thought.

## How it works

It's a simple game, you choose a number between 1 and 10 and press ENTER, the algorithm gonna try to guess your number. You can also play with another range of numbers like 1 to 100 and etc. Remember that the algorithm improves accuracy every time you play the game.

**Thanks for read me!**
