# Guessing Game

This is a project in python to learn algorithms. I'm trying to do a algorithm that guess the number that the user thought.

## How it works

It's a simple game, you choose a number between 1 and 10 and press ENTER, the algorithm gonna try to guess your number.

## To Do

- [x] README
- [x] Refactor the code
- [x] Guess the number
- [x] Don't repeat tries
- [x] Try the next number according to user answer
- [ ] If the first try is 1 or 10 and it's not the user number automatically try another number lower or higher 
- [x] If there's only one number left, don't ask the user if that is the number choosed, just affirm that is
- [ ] Don't let the user choose a invalid lower or higher option if the current try -1 or +1 is equal to last try
- [x] Make the code scalable
- [ ] Translate the code to english

**Thanks for read me!**
